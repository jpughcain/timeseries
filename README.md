* Remove any nulls.

### Test for stationarity and seasonality
* If data is not stationary, apply the appropriate method to create stationarity.

### Decompose the data

### Review spectral density

### Create test/train datasets by splitting the dataset.

### Run the model using train dataset.

### Predict using the test dataset and evaluate model performance.

### Make any adjustments to the model and evaluate.

### Predict the next 30 days and plot predictions.
