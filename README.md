# timeseries analysis
### Research question: Can trends in revenue be identified using time series analysis to predict how revenue will continue?

### Steps:
#### 1. Data preparation:
* Explore the existing shape and structure of the data.
* Check for duplicates
* Remove any nulls.

#### 2. Test for stationarity and seasonality
* If data is not stationary, apply the appropriate method to create stationarity.

#### 3. Decompose the data

#### 4. Review spectral density

#### 5. Create test/train datasets by splitting the dataset.

#### 6. Run the model using train dataset.

#### 7. Predict using the test dataset and evaluate model performance.

#### 8. Make any adjustments to the model and evaluate.

#### 9. Predict the next 30 days and plot predictions.

#### Outcome:The current model can adequately predict revenue for the next 90 days. Forecasting should not extend past a year and is better on shorter time frames. Due to variances that can occur, it is recommended more recent data should be evaluated before predicting data more than 90 days to ensure the best outcome with forecasting revenue.
