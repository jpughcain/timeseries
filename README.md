### Research question: Can trends in revenue be identified using time series analysis to predict how revenue will continue?
### 1. Data preparation:
* Explore the existing shape and structure of the data.
* Check for duplicates
* Remove any nulls.

### 2. Test for stationarity and seasonality
* If data is not stationary, apply the appropriate method to create stationarity.

### 3. Decompose the data

### 4. Review spectral density

### 5. Create test/train datasets by splitting the dataset.

### 6. Run the model using train dataset.

### 7. Predict using the test dataset and evaluate model performance.

### 8. Make any adjustments to the model and evaluate.

### 9. Predict the next 30 days and plot predictions.
